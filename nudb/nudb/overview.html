      NuDB is an append only, key/value store specifically optimized for random read
      performance on modern SSDs or equivalent high-IOPS decices. The most common
      application for NuDB is content addressible storage where a cryptographic digest
      of the data is used as the key. The read performance and memory usage are independent
      of the size of the database. These are some other features:

    </h4>
<p>
      The first versions of rippled, the application behind the Ripple consensus
      network, used SQLite as their back end for unstructured data. The performance
      quickly became a limiting factor.
    </p>
<p>
      Then rippled then went through a series of back ends including LMDB, LevelDB,
      and RocksDB. Each of these databases performed well at first, but as the data
      size increased, memory usage increased and performance dropped off drastically.
    </p>
<p>
      The problem is caching. Each of these databases relies on some O(n) data structure,
      such as a Bloom filter, to improve their performance. These work well until
      the structures no longer fit in memory. In addition, many virtual machines
      are memory constrained.
    </p>
<p>
      To address this issue, the developers performed a thought experiment -- if
      you assume the data size is so large that no O(n) caching is effective, what
      is the best read performance you could expect? They reached the following conclusions:
    </p>
<p>
      1) Writes should not block reads. 2) Reads should be limited only by the SSD's
      IOPS limit. 3) A read for a non-present key should require one IOP. 4) A read
      for a present key whose data can be read in a single IOP should only require
      two IOPs, one to figure out where it is and one to read it in.
    </p>
<p>
      NuDB is designed to come as close to this ideal as possible.
    </p>

    </h4>
<p>
      NuDB uses three files to hold the data and indexes. The data file is append
      only and contains sufficient information to rebuild the index. The index file
      is random access and contains hash buckets. When an update is in progress,
      a temporary journal file is used to roll the update back if needed.
    </p>
<p>
      NuDB uses linear hashing to dynamically increase the number of buckets in the
      index file as the data size grows. Bucket overflows are handled by adding "overflow"
      records to the data file. Bucket overflows can be minimized by increasing the
      number of buckets, leading to a size/speed tradeoff. Typical databases keep
      the average bucket half full (or half empty, depending on your point of view)
      resulting in spill records accounting for less than 1% of reads.
    </p>
<p>
      Inserts are buffered in memory and appended to the data file immediately. Updates
      to the index file are performed as an atomic operation. Fetch operations retrieve
      records in the process of being modified from memory during the update operation
      so that writes do not block fetches.
    </p>
<p>
      Before the index file is modified, a journal file is created to recover consistency
      in the event of a crash during the update. The recovery process will index
      all records written to the data file, so the aggregation of index updates does
      not increase the time which a crash would result in loss of data.
    </p>
<p>
      Iteration can be performed on the data file directly. Since it is append only,
      there is no risk of other operations corrupting an iteration in progress.

    </h4>
<p>
      Writes do not block reads. Read rates are typically around 90% of the SSD's
      IOPS limit. An average fetch for a non-present key typically requires fewer
      than 1.01 IOPs. An average fetch for a present key requires fewer than 1.01
      IOPs plus however many IOPs it takes to read the data.

    </h4>
<p>
      Content addressable storage associates data with its cryptographic digest.
      This type of storage is commonly used in decentralized blockchain applications.
    </p>
<p>
      Often these applications require following hash chains -- where one object
      contains the hash of another object that ultimately leads to the object desired.
      NuDB's low latency and high speed are particularly advantageous in these kinds
      of applications.
    </p>
<p>
      NuDB is append only and does not support a delete operation. To support retaining
      limited historical information, NuDB is often used in a dual database configuration.
      One database is older and is read only, the other is newer and is read/write.
      Periodically, the older database is discarded and the newer database becomes
      the new read only database and a new read/write database is created.
