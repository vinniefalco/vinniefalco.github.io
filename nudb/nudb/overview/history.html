        The first versions of rippled, the application behind the Ripple consensus
        network, used SQLite as their back end for unstructured data. The performance
        quickly became a limiting factor.
      </p>
<p>
        Then rippled then went through a series of back ends including LMDB, LevelDB,
        and RocksDB. Each of these databases performed well at first, but as the
        data size increased, memory usage increased and performance dropped off drastically.
      </p>
<p>
        The problem is caching. Each of these databases relies on some O(n) data
        structure, such as a Bloom filter, to improve their performance. These work
        well until the structures no longer fit in memory. In addition, many virtual
        machines are memory constrained.
      </p>
<p>
        To address this issue, the developers performed a thought experiment -- if
        you assume the data size is so large that no O(n) caching is effective, what
        is the best read performance you could expect? They reached the following
        conclusions:
      </p>
<p>
        1) Writes should not block reads. 2) Reads should be limited only by the
        SSD's IOPS limit. 3) A read for a non-present key should require one IOP.
        4) A read for a present key whose data can be read in a single IOP should
        only require two IOPs, one to figure out where it is and one to read it in.
      </p>
<p>
        NuDB is designed to come as close to this ideal as possible.
