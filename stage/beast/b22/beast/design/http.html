        For HTTP we to model the message to maximize flexibility of implementation
        strategies while allowing familiar verbs such as <span class="bold"><strong><code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">read</span></code></strong></span> and <span class="bold"><strong><code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">write</span></code></strong></span>. The HTTP interface is
        further driven by the needs of the WebSocket module, as a WebSocket session
        requires a HTTP Upgrade handshake exchange at the start. Other design goals:

          certificates would help."" </span></dt>
<dd><p>
              The HTTP interface doesn't try to reinvent the wheel, it just uses
              the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">boost</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">asio</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">ip</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">tcp</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">socket</span></code> or <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">boost</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">asio</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">ssl</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">stream</span></code>
              that you set up beforehand. Callers use the interfaces already existing
              on those objects to make outgoing connections, accept incoming connections,
              or establish TLS sessions with certificates. We find the available
              Asio examples for performing these tasks sufficient.
            </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"> "A built-in router?" </span></dt>
<dd><p>
              We presume this means a facility to match expressions against the URI
              in HTTP requests, and dispatch them to calling code. The authors feel
              that this is a responsibility of higher level code. Beast.HTTP does
              not try to offer a web server.
            </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"> "Cookies? Forms/File Uploads?" </span></dt>
<dd><p>
              Cookies, or managing these types of HTTP headers in general, is the
              responsibility of higher levels. Beast.HTTP just tries to get complete
              messages to and from the calling code. It deals in the HTTP headers
              just enough to process the message body and leaves the rest to callers.
              However, for forms and file uploads the symmetric interface of the
              message class allows HTTP requests to include arbitrary body types
              including those needed to upload a file or fill out a form.

<dt><span class="term"> "...supporting TLS (is this a feature? If not this would be
          a show-stopper), etc."" </span></dt>
<dd><p>
              Beast.HTTP does not provide direct facilities for implementing TLS
              connections; however, the interfaces already existing on the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">boost</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">asio</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">ssl</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">stream</span></code> are available and can be used
              to establish secure connections. Then, functions like <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">http</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">read</span></code> or <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">http</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">async_write</span></code>
              can work with those encrypted connections with no problem.
            </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"> "There should also be more examples of how to integrate the
          http service with getting files from the file system, generating responses
          CGI-style" </span></dt>
<dd>
<p>
              The design goal for the library is to not try to invent a web server.
              We feel that there is a strong need for a basic implementation that
              models the HTTP message and provides functions to send and receive
              them over Asio. Such an implementation should serve as a building block
              upon which higher abstractions such as the aforementioned HTTP service
              or cgi-gateway can be built.
            </p>
<p>
              One of the example programs implements a simple HTTP server that delivers
              files from the filesystem.
            </p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term"> "You should send a 100-continue to ask for the rest of the
          body if required." </span></dt>
<dd><p>
              The Beast interface needs to support this functionality (by allowing
              this special case of partial message parsing and serialization). Specifically,
              it should let callers read the request up to just before the body,
              and let callers write the request up to just before the body. However,
              making use of this behavior should be up to callers (since Beast is
              low level).
            </p></dd>
<dt><span class="term"> "What about HTTP/2?" </span></dt>
<dd>
<p>
              Many reviewers feel that HTTP/2 support is an essential feature of
              a HTTP library. The authors agree that HTTP/2 is important but also
              feel that the most sensible implementation is one that does not re-use
              the same network reading and writing interface for 2 as that for 1.0
              and 1.1.
            </p>
<p>
              The Beast.HTTP message model is suitable for HTTP/2 and can be re-used.
              The IEFT HTTP Working Group adopted message compatiblity with HTTP/1.x
              as an explicit goal. A parser can simply emit full headers after decoding
              the compressed HTTP/2 headers. The stream ID is not logically part
              of the message but rather message metadata and should be communicated
              out-of-band (see below). HTTP/2 sessions begin with a traditional HTTP/1.1
              Upgrade similar in fashion to the WebSocket upgrade. A HTTP/2 implementation
              can use existing Beast.HTTP primitives to perform this handshake.
            </p>
<p>
              Free functions for HTTP/2 sessions are not possible because of the
              requirement to maintain per-session state. For example, to decode the
              compressed headers. Or to remember and respect the remote peer's window
              settings. The authors propose that a HTTP/2 implementation be written
              as a separate class template, similar to the <code class="computeroutput"><span class="identifier">websocket</span><span class="special">::</span><span class="identifier">stream</span></code>
              but with additional interfaces to support version 2 features. We feel
              that Beast.HTTP offers enough useful functionality to justify inclusion,
              so that developers can take advantage of it right away instead of waiting.
